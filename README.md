## Overview

Ladybug automates bug localization by triggering an analysis whenever a new issue is created in your GitHub repository. The Probot bot listens for new issues, and the Flask backend processes the issue data to provide bug localization results.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **Git** installed
- Access to the GitHub repository where you want to install the bot

---

## Setup

### Flask Backend Setup

#### Initialize Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Linux/Mac:**

  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and start the Flask application:

```bash
cd backend
python index.py
```

### Probot Bot Setup

#### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the Probot directory and install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
cd ../probot
npm install
```

#### Create a GitHub App

1. **Start the Bot Setup**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Register a New GitHub App**

   - Follow the prompts in the terminal.
   - You'll be directed to GitHub to register a new GitHub App.
   - **Important:** When setting up the app, grant access only to the specific repository you intend to use. Do not select all repositories.

3. **Configure Webhooks and Permissions**

   - Set the required webhook URLs and permissions if instructed.
   - The setup process will automatically configure your environment variables.

#### Run the Bot

After setting up the GitHub App, restart the bot to apply the changes:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Usage

With both the backend and bot running:

- **Create a New Issue** in the GitHub repository where the bot is installed.
- The bot will automatically process the issue and **comment with bug localization results**.
- **Verify Communication:**
  - Check the terminal running the Flask backend for processing logs.
  - Check the terminal running the Probot bot for event handling logs.

---

## Additional Commands

### Installing New Python Packages

To add new packages to the Flask backend:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

After you're done working:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot Doesn't Respond to Issues:**
  - Ensure the bot is running (`npm start`).
  - Verify the GitHub App is installed on your repository.
  - Check webhook configurations in the GitHub App settings.

- **Backend Errors:**
  - Confirm all Python dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
  - Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running the backend.

- **Environment Variable Issues:**
  - Double-check that environment variables were set during the GitHub App creation.
  - Restart the bot after any changes to environment variables.
- **Why is the bot not on marketplace?** 
  - The bot is currently can't be deployed on the marketplace due to the lack of a server to host the bot. Until then, the bot can only be run locally in a development environment.
